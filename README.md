I am a DevSecOps and Site Reliability Engineer. I wrestle with cloud infrastructure automation during my day job. I help enterprises streamline their infrastructure and application architecture, wrangle costs, and dominate issues with security, compliance, stardardisation and documentation. I also volunteer as tester for some open source applications in my free time.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Infrastructure Architecture for Tasking Manager
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning OpenPolicyAgent (for Terraform), Pydantic, and Rust - let's see how that goes.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about technology ethics, labour rights, and the perils of solutionism (apart from what is above)

Not all me's online are me.
